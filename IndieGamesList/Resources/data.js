        "name" : "Starbound", "developer" : "Chucklefish LTD", "genre" : "Sandbox, Exploration, Building", "release" : "December 4, 2013", "review" : "no reviews yet", "about" : "Starbound while still in beta available since December 4, 2013 on Steam through early access is a game about exploring strange new planets. When you start the game you find out that you are in your spaceship orbiting a planet and that you have run out of fuel. The game gives you some simple quests and goals at that point and you have to go to the planet and start building some survival gear as well as trying to gather fuel for your spaceship so you can leave the planet and go explore other planets. Throughout your journey you will mine and build weapons and armor as well as structures that you can spend your nights in to survive. You will also need to cook and grow food so you donâ€™t starve as well as trying to keep warm and alive. The game has at least one developer from Terraria which many people are convinced that Starbound is just a rip off of Terraria, however there are many differences between the games."

        "name" : "Prison Architect", "developer" : "Introversion Software", "genre" : "Tycoon, Simulation", "release" : "September 25, 2012", "review" : "8.8 out of 10", "about" : "Prison Architect is a game all about designing and running your very own prison. The game gives you complete control over your prison from where you place what to who sleeps next to whom. You can search cells, find escape tunnels, make your prisoners earn their keep by working them, chose when they eat and sleep and even shower. You must be careful with your choices though as messing up can lead to prisoner riots and escapes as well as costing your guards and other employees their very lives. The game is still in alpha at this point but is one of the best games available even compared to already finished games."
